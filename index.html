                    <p id="paragraph">My name is Morgan Maxwell, and I'm hopeful to begin a career in computer programming. I am in the starting stages of a coding boot camp, which will provide me with the skills I need to be a high quality full-stack developer. I already enjoy creating things, and building this website has been an incredible source of experience and excitement for what could eventually be a career. The basic work of coding is incredibly interesting to me. 
                        
                        I have already fallen in love with HTML and CSS, and I have barely scratched the surface of the shortcuts and techniques for the two of those, let alone the other things we will learn in the class.</p>
